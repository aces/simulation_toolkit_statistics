Here is the description of how to use the simulation fuction is Matlab:

This function evaluates the effect of deformation on CIVET/FS results, i.e. thicknesses for deformed vs. the unaltered IBIS-Phantom/ICBM datasets
Supported Versions CIVET: 2.0,2.1.0,2.1.1 and FreeSurfer 5.3 and 6.0

Usage:  sta = statisticalanalysis(pipelinen, csv_filename, meter, sm_fwhm, ptv, ttv, c_centre, roi_right, roi_left, output_folder)
e.g. sta=statisticalanalysis('CIVET','IBIS_ph_Def40_Size10_Final_ROI4_civet21.csv','tlaplace','0',0.05, 5.3,[65;15;20],'ROI4_size10_right.txt','ROI4_size10_left.txt','/results')


 NOTE : Four cubic ROIs are selected and the deformation are applied in
         these areas (in STEROTAXIC space) (top/left/back coordinates)
            ROI1: Sensory area (x,y,z:w) 11,-11,72
            ROI2: ACC (x,y,z:w) 8,44,8
            ROI3: Precuneus (x,y,z:w) -2,-63,35
            ROI4: Superior Temporal area (x,y,z:w) 65,-16,20
                  We have also considered an ellipsoid ROI at the same position as ROI5 with size 10x5x5 mm
 NOTE : The unaltered and deformed volumes are available at CBRAIN portal: https://portal.cbrain.mcgill.ca/ in 
         cortical deformation project.
 NOTE : This function uses SrfStat toolbox:
            http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/
 NOTE : Please set and save the folders containing the surface. Sample files and masks and sample CSV files are also          included.
 NOTE : For your own tests you should provide CSV files similar to the available samples.
         Two first columns contain the list of the name of measured thickness files for left and right hemispheres.
         Third column has the information about the unaltered (r0) or deformed (rd) files.
         Forth column assigns numbers to each MRI scan.
